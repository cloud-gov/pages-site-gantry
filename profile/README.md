## Why cloud.gov?

### Compliant from the Start
cloud.gov offers a fast way for federal agencies to host and update websites, APIs, and other applications. Employees and contractors can focus on developing mission-critical applications, leaving server infrastructure management to us.

### FedRAMP Authorized
cloud.gov has a FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB) authorization, which means it complies with federal security requirements. When you build a system on cloud.gov, you leverage this compliance and reduce the amount of work you need to do.
